Today is also a normal day. I got up a little early in the morning, but I don't know what I should review today. I feel that what I should review is almost finished. There is also a wireless sensor that hasn't been reviewed. This door makes me feel very uncomfortable. I don't know how to review. My two roommates haven't started to review yet, ha ha
